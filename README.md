#  CavernSeer [PROTOTYPING]
> An iPadOS application for scanning 3D spaces

Leverages the 2020 iPad Pro's LiDAR scanner and RealityKit's scene reconstruction
to generate relatively-accurate 3D meshes of real-world spaces. 

## Getting Started

Depends on **iOS 14** functionality and thus requires **Xcode 12**.
